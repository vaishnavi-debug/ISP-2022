A Sci-Fi/Horror First-Person 3D Unity Game

##Plot
Our game centers around the entralling adventure of a brilliant scientist and a raging mutant as they attempt to escape an alien invasion on their space station. 

##Game Mechanics
Gameplay is divided between segments of gameplay centered around the scientist and the mutant.
###Scientist
The scientist can be considered to be the "brains" of the two as the play will be required to perform actions fitting the expertise of the scientist with puzzles (could be anagrams, solving ciphers, performing system maintenance).
###Mutant
Fitting to the name, this character involves more combat elements with puzzles consisting of visuals and utilizing their abilities to progress through the space station. In order to control their abilities, this mutant also has a dampener permanently attached to their arm which, when unlocked, provides the player the opportunity to perform uprades to the device to thereby "upgrade" the mutant's abilities.
